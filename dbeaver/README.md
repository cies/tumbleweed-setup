dbeaver
=======

A great tool for interfacing with (remote) databases. It's not available in OpenSUSE's default repos so we download the package directly from the vendor.

```sh
cd /tmp
wget -c https://dbeaver.io/files/dbeaver-ce-latest-stable.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh dbeaver-ce-latest-stable.x86_64.rpm
```
